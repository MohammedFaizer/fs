# Enhancing Cricket Game Using Virtual Reality

## Introduction

Welcome to the Virtual Reality Cricket Game in Unreal Engine! This project aims to provide an immersive cricket experience using Unreal Engine and Virtual Reality (VR) technology. This README file will guide you through the setup process and provide an overview of the game.

## Requirements

- Unreal Engine 5.3 or later
- VR Headset (Meta Quest3 etc.)
- Motion Controllers (Meta quest Controller etc.)
- A computer capable of running Unreal Engine and VR applications
- Minimum Graphic Card for Shader's Compilations (eg RTX 3050 )

## Installation

1. Download the project from the Drive Link : [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ceqAL1JAcBztWXTznPjcQgtl116tFuxH?usp=drive_link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ceqAL1JAcBztWXTznPjcQgtl116tFuxH?usp=drive_link)
2. Unzip the File.
3. Open the project in Unreal Engine.
4. Ensure that your VR headset and motion controllers are connected and properly set up.
5. Compile the project if necessary.
6. Launch the game in VR mode.

## Controls

- **Batting**: Swing the motion controller to hit the ball.
- **3D UI Interaction**: Use the motion controller to aim and press the 3D button in Game World.
- **Fielding**: When the ball spawned fielding logic is activated.
- **Bowling**:When the Next ball button is Pressed the ball will be spawned.

## Gameplay

The game features a realistic cricket environment, including a stadium, players, and crowd. You will be choosen to play as a batsman. The objective is to score as many runs as possible while batting without loosing wickets.

## Known Issues

- Occasionally, the ball may not behave as expected due to physics glitches.
- Some VR headsets may experience performance issues, especially with high-resolution textures and effects.
- Having Crowd in Stadium leads to performance issue.

## Future Improvements

- Implement more realistic physics for the ball and player movements.
- Improve the AI for single-player mode.
- Replacing the Crowd with Niagra For Crowd simulation .
